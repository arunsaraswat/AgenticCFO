## How to Use the `/ux-review` Command

### Basic Usage

```bash
/ux-review
```
Reviews all frontend files for UX/UI compliance

### Specific File Review

```bash
/ux-review src/components/Dashboard.tsx
```
Reviews a single component

### Focused Reviews

```bash
/ux-review --accessibility
```
Focus on WCAG compliance only

```bash
/ux-review --mobile
```
Focus on responsive design only

```bash
/ux-review --performance
```
Focus on rendering performance

## Key Design Principles

### From Reference Dashboards

1. **Data-First Hierarchy**
   - KPIs at top, scannable in < 5 seconds
   - Progressive disclosure (summary → details)
   - White space for breathing room

2. **Professional Aesthetic**
   - Blue color scheme (trust, finance industry standard)
   - Minimalist design (no chart junk)
   - Consistent spacing and alignment

3. **Scannable Layout**
   - Clear section headers
   - Related data grouped
   - Grid-based alignment

4. **Contextual Filtering**
   - Persistent filter bar
   - Clear "Values" sections showing current filters
   - Drill-down capabilities

5. **Number Formatting**
   - Currency: `$1,234.56` (always 2 decimals)
   - Percentages: `12.3%` (1 decimal)
   - Large numbers: `1.2M`, `345K`
   - Trends: `↑ 2.1%` (with direction indicator)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Visual:**
- Chart junk (3D effects, gradients)
- Rainbow charts (> 6 colors)
- Tiny text (< 10px)
- Neon colors (high saturation)

❌ **Interaction:**
- Mystery meat (icons without labels)
- Auto-play carousels
- Modal overload (> 2 deep)

❌ **Data:**
- Truncated numbers without tooltips
- Missing units ($, %, etc.)
- Unlabeled axes

❌ **Layout:**
- Dense tables (< 32px rows)
- Busy backgrounds
- Inconsistent spacing

---

## Example Review Findings

### Button Component Review

**Strengths:**
- ✅ TypeScript typing
- ✅ Loading state
- ✅ Focus ring
- ✅ Disabled handling

**Issues:**
- 🟢 Use `bg-blue-600` instead of `bg-primary-600` (design system)
- 🟢 Change `rounded-lg` to `rounded` (4px for buttons)

**Enhancements:**
- Add icon support for dashboard actions
- Add size variants (sm/md/lg)
- Improve ARIA labels for screen readers

**Time to Fix:** ~40 minutes
